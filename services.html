    <figcaption>The insatiable need to learn and grow is part of the fundamental nature of all human beings. Our team
      accomplishes both by continually seeking out new and more efficient ways to provide custom application development
      services at Active Bridge. We encourage our developers to constantly pursue new knowledge, whether it be taking
      educational courses, attending conferences, or just sharing their knowledge around the office, or contributing to
      open source. We believe that where there is growth, there is innovation, and that belief drives us forward.

        <h6>Initial Negotiations</h6>
        <p>Our development company starts with the initial brief you give to us. During the introductory call, we
          discuss
          your project goal in detail. This is where you need to clearly communicate your background, priorities, goals,
          and limitations.</p>

        <h6>Analyzing inquiries and preparing a proposal</h6>
        <p>After the initial discussion, our remote developers prepare follow-up questions to clarify our understanding
          of your project needs. Also, our dedicated team prepares a proposal, describing prospective technology,
          budget, and time frames. If you request, we can negotiate an NDA</p>

        <p>Its the right moment for sharing all the related documentation, such as technical specifications, business
          use cases, wireframes, designer materials, and preliminary sketches that could be of use to the development
          team. Having come to understand your requirements we provide a Statement of Work or some other document that
          clearly describes prospective technology, budget, time frames, the tools that the full-stack developers use,
          the roles and responsibilities of the team members involved</p>

        <h6>Sign the agreement and start the development process</h6>
        <p>Our remote development teams follow the Agile project management methodology. For most projects, we use Scrum
          and can cover all development roles. We divide the routine development tasks into 2-week long sprints. Also,
          we provide daily stand-up meetings talking about the progress of the tasks, report roadblocks. You and your
          in-house team can also take an active part in the discussion and be fully involved in the development process
