    <figcaption>The insatiable need to learn and grow is part of the fundamental nature of all human beings. Our team
      accomplishes both by continually seeking out new and more efficient ways to provide custom application development
      services at Active Bridge. We encourage our developers to constantly pursue new knowledge, whether it be taking
      educational courses, attending conferences, or just sharing their knowledge around the office, or contributing to
      open source. We believe that where there is growth, there is innovation, and that belief drives us forward.
